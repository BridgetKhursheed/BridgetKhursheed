**poet&geek stuff**

Outside there’s a pink light pressing through twilight  
like a bruise, the snappy teeth of pine  
all snarled by winds; but I beast the weather,  
get the mills generating electricity.  
They set to it: all the commuters pay my tithe in bread and sugar  
until the salt-licked windows bow down and reveal  

that bit of moor again. And it’s looking the other way.
